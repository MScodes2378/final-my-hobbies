            <p id="About">Hello everybody I’m really happy to share my hobbies with you and I really appreciate the valuable time that your put in reading this piece of text and let’s get to the point of what my hobbies are I have three hobbies gaming, art and coding from which you can see this piece of text.<br>
                The thing why I like these things is this fact that you can put endless effort into these things but you will never be the best or happy with the results so you can keep on pushing yourself to stay up the score and you can never get tired like for example in coding there are endless possibility’s the thing on your computer that you see now and that you see in the future are all done with coding.<br>
                In first-person shooter games it is a bad concept but these games are never-ending you have to discover new things almost every day and every day you will find a player that is better so you can’t get bored.<br>
                Art it is the thing that is so old but still, improvements are being made in the way even after thousands of year people keep the following art and in art, you don’t have any competition because every artist has there own unique style and you can always be happy with your results and keep on improving it can’t be learned it only can be experienced.<br>
                So this is all about my hobbies I hope you were admired for all the possibilities with these three things so thank you for your time and bye !!!.<br>  </p>
